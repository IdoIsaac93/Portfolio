        <h3>Monster Hunter - Lead Developer</h3>
        <p>This was my first project using the Unity game engine, completed individually 
            for my game design class at Centennial College. I took on the entire 
            process—designing, coding, and building the game myself. Throughout development, 
            I encountered numerous challenges and made several mistakes, but each one became 
            a valuable learning experience. As a result, my subsequent projects have been more 
            polished and of a higher caliber.</p>

            <h3>Calculator - Programmer</h3>
            <p>During my studies in C# programming, I was tasked with developing a fully 
                functional calculator. This project showcased my understanding of coding 
                principles, as well as my ability to implement design and UI/UX concepts 
                in my applications. I received top marks for this assignment, and it was 
                selected as an example of exemplary coding practices.
