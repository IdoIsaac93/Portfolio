                <h3>Monster Hunter - Lead Developer</h3>
                <p>This was my first project using the Unity game engine, completed individually 
                    for my game design class at Centennial College. I took on the entire 
                    processâ€”designing, coding, and building the game myself. Throughout development, 
                    I encountered numerous challenges and made several mistakes, but each one 
                    became a valuable learning experience. As a result, my subsequent projects 
                    have been more polished and of a higher caliber.</p>

                <h3>Calculator - Programmer</h3>
                <p>During my studies in C# programming, I was tasked with developing a fully 
                    functional calculator. This project showcased my understanding of coding 
                    principles, as well as my ability to implement design and UI/UX concepts 
                    in my applications. I received top marks for this assignment, and it was 
                    selected as an example of exemplary coding practices.</p>

                <h3>Bowie - Lead Developer</h3>
                <p>This is my current project, an innovative archery game developed using the 
                    Unity game engine. As the lead developer, I am responsible for designing 
                    the levels and mechanics, and I handle all coding and programming myself. 
                    This project allows me to explore creative game design elements and push 
                    the boundaries of traditional gameplay. Although it is still in progress, 
                    I am excited about the unique features and engaging experiences that will 
                    come to life as development continues.</p>
