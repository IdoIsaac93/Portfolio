            <p>
                I hold a high school diploma with a major in arts and graphic design, 
                which laid the foundation for my creative journey. Following high school, 
                I pursued further studies in graphic design at "HackerU" where I developed 
                my skills in visual communication and design principles. This formal education 
                has equipped me with the necessary tools to translate ideas into compelling designs.

                During my military service, I underwent extensive leadership training, 
                which included squad leader training and command responsibilities. This 
                experience not only enhanced my leadership skills but also taught me the 
                value of mentorship and teamwork. In my professional career, I've continued 
                to apply these skills as a mentor and team leader, fostering collaboration 
                and supporting the growth of my colleagues.

                I am currently enrolled at Centennial College, studying game programming, further 
                expanding my knowledge and skills in the ever-evolving field of technology and design. 
                I hope to apply my experience and knowledge to good use in the gaming industry.
