                Hello! I'm Ido Isaac, a passionate game programmer and dedicated professional.
                 With a background in arts and graphic design, I combine creativity with strong leadership skills 
                 developed during my military service as a field intelligence operative. My experience has taught me the importance 
                 of teamwork and effective communication, enabling me to thrive in both collaborative and independent environments.
            </p>
            <p>
                After my military service, I excelled as a sales representative at JR Duty Free, where I earned multiple customer 
                service awards and trained new employees. I take pride in my ability to understand customer needs while promoting larger sales. 
                Fluent in Hebrew and proficient in English, I am always eager to connect with diverse audiences and explore new opportunities.
            </p>
